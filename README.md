# Deep-Learning-in-Archiving-Indus-Script-and-Motif-Information
This repository focuses on using deep learning to digitize, classify, and archive Indus script symbols and motifs, aiding in their preservation and analysis.

# Project Overview
This repository is structured into three main folders, each corresponding to different phases of the project:
    1. Training and Validation Phase (MobileNet code for Jupyter notebook)
    2. Motif Identification (Code for Jupyter notebook)
    3. Grapheme Identification (Code for Jupyter notebook)
    
# Training and Validation Phase
This phase involves training models for object detection and classification. Three models are utilized:
    • YOLOv3: A pre-trained model used for initial object detection available at the reference provided.
    • MobileNet: A lightweight deep learning model with its implementation shared in the MobileNet file.
    • CNN Model: A custom convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in the MipNet folder.
    
# Motif Identification
The MotifIdentification folder contains the source code for motif detection using deep learning models. This phase involves analyzing patterns and structures relevant to the project.

# Grapheme Identification
In the final stage, grapheme identification is performed, and results are validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability.

# Data
The full data sets may be obtained from authors upon request. To facilitate understanding and reproducibility, we have provided sample data of each data type.
